# NFA_to_DFA
A C program written to convert Non-Deterministic Finite Automation to Deterministic Finite Automation
The program uses lazy method to convet NFA to DFA and based on a tree based algorithm where nodes of the tree represent a particular state. The program is given the input as the transition table and output is the image of the dfa generated by graphviz. Please install graphviz before running the program.
To run:
	$ gcc nfa_to_dfa.c
	$ ./a.out
